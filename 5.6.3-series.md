# 5.6.3 Series

[Return to main page](index.md)

Note: ODBC(Windows only) and SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage. All Dynamic builds have -plugin-sql-xxx.

Note: Windows builds have -openssl-linked. It links to a dynamic OpenSSL 1.0.2 series which redistributed in the package.

Note: All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of time, useless for common users.
