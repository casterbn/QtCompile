# Fsu0413's Original Qt builds

## Website mirror

Since GitHub Pages is slow in China, I made a mirror website using a Chinese code hosting service called Coding.

[GitHub](https://fsu0413.github.io/QtCompile/): Global  
[Coding](https://alyack.coding-pages.com/): The People's Republic of China

## GPG sign

I am working on a method to GPG sign every package, but I didn't find a good method.  
I don't want to put the signature file besides the package, I think it will be a waste of upload step......

## Disclaimer

These binaries built by Fsu0413 are __TOTALLY UNTESTED__. Use at your own risk.

The code used is downloaded from [here](http://download.qt.io), I made no changes to the source/generated files.

__THESE PACKAGE ARE PROVIDED "As is", I have no responsibility that you mess up your things with this binaries.__

Thanks for The Qt Company Ltd. and the programmers of Qt for their fantastic work!!

## Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 deprecation (IMPORTANT NOTES!!)

SINCE 2020.6.3 (Qt 5.15 release and Qt 5.9 deprecation) ONLY VS2015 AND MINGW 7.3 BUILDS SUPPORTS WINDOWS 8.1.  
WINDOWS 10 IS MORE AND MORE POPULAR, AND RECEIVING MORE AND MORE NEW FEATURES. ONE SHOULD SWITCH TO WINDOWS 10 ASAP.

SINCE 2020.1.6 (OpenSSL 1.0.2 deprecation) NO LATER BUILD WILL SUPPORT WINDOWS 8 AND EARLIER, PLEASE UPDATE TO WINDOWS 8.1 AND LATER.
