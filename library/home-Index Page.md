# Fsu0413's Original Qt builds

## GPG sign

I am working on a method to GPG sign every package, but I didn't find a good method.  
I don't want to put the signature file besides the package, I think it will be a waste of upload step......

## Disclaimer

These binaries built by Fsu0413 are __TOTALLY UNTESTED__. Use at your own risk.

The code used is downloaded from [here](http://download.qt.io), I made no changes to the source/generated files.

__THESE PACKAGE ARE PROVIDED "As is", I have no responsibility that you mess up your things with this binaries.__

Thanks for The Qt Company Ltd. and the programmers of Qt for their fantastic work!!
