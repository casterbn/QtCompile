# 5.12.6 for WebAssembly

Note: SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage and have -plugin-sql-sqlite

Note: All packages have -no-ssl because of compile failure with -ssl -openssl-linked.

Note: All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.

Note: All builds are using emscripten SDK 1.38.16 as recommended in Qt Wiki.

Note: Qt for WebAssembly can't be compiled to shared libs.

## Static Builds

### Linux Host

Build host: Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS, with "apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade" run before building
