# 5.9.8 for macOS

Note: SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage and have -plugin-sql-sqlite

Note: All builds have -no-openssl -securetransport. It means that we are using Secure Transport library of macOS to provide SSL connections.

Note: All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.
