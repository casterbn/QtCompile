# Fsu0413's Qt builds

## Disclaimer

The code used is downloaded from [here](http://download.qt.io), I only made necessary changes to the source/generated makefile to pass the build.

__THESE PACKAGE ARE PROVIDED "As is", I have no responsibility that you mess up your things with this binaries.__

Thanks for The Qt Company Ltd. and the programmers of Qt for their fantastic work!!
